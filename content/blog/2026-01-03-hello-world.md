This is my first post. I'm writing it from my phone, which is the whole point.

## How this works

Just create a markdown file in `content/blog/` with this format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-your-title-here.md
```

Add some front matter at the top:

```toml
+++
title = "Your Post Title"
date = 2026-01-03
+++
```

Then write your post in markdown. Push to GitHub and it goes live.

That's it. No build step on your end, just markdown files.
