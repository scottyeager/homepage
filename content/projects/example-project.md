This is an example project page. Projects work just like blog posts but live in `content/projects/` instead of `content/blog/`.

## What goes here

Write about what the project is, how it works, what you learned. Link to the repo if it's public.

## The difference from blog posts

- No date required (but you can add one if you want)
- Can have a `status` field in `[extra]` (Active, Complete, Abandoned, etc.)
- Shows up on the Projects page instead of the Blog

That's about it. Same markdown, different section.
